# Relay configuration file for use with the in-game verb "Internet Routing Relays"
# Code can be found in code/modules/relays/relays.dm
# Format should match the below:
#
# [[relay]]
# id = "example_relay"
# name = "Connect to Example Relay (Location/Comment)"
# quickname = "Example Relay"
# address = "byond://useast.monkestation.com:{port}"
